The purpose of this investigation was to develop a covid-based model using large quantities of relevant data to predict economic stability in different U.S. cities. In this model, we implement factors such as a city’s resilience, significant industries, and daily mobility patterns to discover a city’s ability to fight against this deadly virus. In this study, we find that cities with smaller population densities and movement patterns not centered around retail (e.g. Raleigh and Durham) are better suited to deal with a pandemic. Conversely, our results show that busier cities that rely more on industries such as retail, tourism, etc. are likely to be hurt immediately and in the long run.
